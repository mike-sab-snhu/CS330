Comp Graphics and Vizualization

>>>>How do I approach designing software?
  I approach designing software from the perspective of a user trying to solve a problem.  Then from there I build small solutions, one at a time, until they develope into larger and more complex solutions that can be used to solve the initial problem with reliability and user convenience.

>>>>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  The project has helped me to develop new design skills like building custom 3D shapes and rendering graphics that create and immersive scene.  I had no familiarity with doing this by building the backend code.  I'd only ever used front end graphic design software.  While that poses it's own challenges, it was far more difficult learning how to code OpenGL to design visuals.

>>>>What design process did you follow for your project work?
  The design process I followed was to create the scene one object at a time.  Luckily the scene wasn't so complex that I needed to build multiple objects simultaneously in order to ensure they coalesced.  With this scene, each object stood alone and I believe my straightforward process of building the shape, then adding texture, and finally making adjustments until it came together just right--worked like a charm. 

>>>>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  In the future, I think that my approach might not be holistic enough and skipped the preparation and design phases, going straight into development.  Future projects would flow smoother if I took time to make sketches and take measurements before building my shapes.  When I built the custom shape for the mouse, I spent a lot of time taking measurements and doing geometry to find the right angles and proportions.  This took a while but it made the final product much nicer.  I would repeat this for all shapes in my scene.

>>>>How do I approach developing programs?
  I approach developing programs by sprinting as fast as possible toward a minimum viable product.  This can lead to problems and design flaws but I find it's best to get something functional created so that I can show "proof of concept" and justify the rest of the effort I'm about to invest.  Once I have that, I can go back and build the project up to standard.

>>>>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  A new development strategy that I used while working on my 3D scene was to bounce between testing and development throughout the process.  I'm not used to doing this but with graphics, it was important to render the scene to ensure everything was working properly.

>>>>How did iteration factor into your development?
  When it came to iteration, I found that I was making baby steps to completion the entire time.  It was all too detailed for me to try large changes without checking to ensure everything lined up properly.  I often made minute adjustments repeatedly to get everything right before moving on to the next step.

>>>>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  My approach to developing code evolved by incorporating more modular code in my designs.  In the beginning, I was mostly just writing code to make it work but this ad hoc method created its own challenges when I added more objects to the scene or when I started using textures and lighting.

>>>>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science can help me reach my goals by giving me the skills to create products that help people and business find success.  If you're able to provide something valuable, people will typically pay you for it, and I find it important to build a career around offering something that makes a positive impact in the world.

>>>>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Computational graphics and visualizations gave me the sort of skills that I can use to learn more about building graphics and potentially even designing GUI that helps users engage the software.  Sometimes a good UI means the difference between success and failure and I think it's great that I have the foundation I need to learn more and do more.

>>>>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  Computational graphics and visualizations gave me knowledge and skills that I can use to pursue hobbies like building a video game, however, my desired profession doesn't quite require the skills I learned in this course.  Trading is more of an engineering focused career field where developers and users are very comfortable staring at a wall of numbers without formatting. The front end work is never so advanced as to need OpenGL.
